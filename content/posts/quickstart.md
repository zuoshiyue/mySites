In this tutorial you will:

1.  Create a site
2.  Add content
3.  Configure the site
4.  Publish the site

## Prerequisites[](#prerequisites)

Before you begin this tutorial you must:

1.  [Install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/installation/) (extended edition, v0.112.0 or later)
2.  [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

You must also be comfortable working from the command line.

## Create a site[](#create-a-site)

### Commands[](#commands)

Run these commands to create a Hugo site with the [Ananke](https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke) theme. The next section provides an explanation of each command.

```text
hugo new site quickstart
cd quickstart
git init
git submodule add https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke.git themes/ananke
echo "theme = 'ananke'" >> hugo.toml
hugo server
```

View your site at the URL displayed in your terminal. Press `Ctrl + C` to stop Hugo’s development server.

### Explanation of commands[](#explanation-of-commands)

Create the [directory structure](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/directory-structure) for your project in the `quickstart` directory.

Change the current directory to the root of your project.

Initialize an empty Git repository in the current directory.

Clone the [Ananke](https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke) theme into the `themes` directory, adding it to your project as a [Git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).

```text
git submodule add https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke.git themes/ananke
```

Append a line to the site configuration file, indicating the current theme.

```text
echo "theme = 'ananke'" >> hugo.toml
```

Start Hugo’s development server to view the site.

Press `Ctrl + C` to stop Hugo’s development server.

## Add content[](#add-content)

Add a new page to your site.

```text
hugo new posts/my-first-post.md
```

Hugo created the file in the `content/posts` directory. Open the file with your editor.

```text
---
title: "My First Post"
date: 2022-11-20T09:03:20-08:00
draft: true
---
```

Notice the `draft` value in the [front matter](https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter) is `true`. By default, Hugo does not publish draft content when you build the site. Learn more about [draft, future, and expired content](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/usage/#draft-future-and-expired-content).

Add some [markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/) to the body of the post, but do not change the `draft` value.

```text
---
title: "My First Post"
date: 2022-11-20T09:03:20-08:00
draft: true
---
## Introduction

This is **bold** text, and this is *emphasized* text.

Visit the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) website!
```

Save the file, then start Hugo’s development server to view the site. You can run either of the following commands to include draft content.

```text
hugo server --buildDrafts
hugo server -D
```

View your site at the URL displayed in your terminal. Keep the development server running as you continue to add and change content.

## Configure the site[](#configure-the-site)

With your editor, open the [site configuration](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration/) file (`hugo.toml`) in the root of your project.

```text
baseURL = 'http://example.org/'
languageCode = 'en-us'
title = 'My New Hugo Site'
theme = 'ananke'
```

Make the following changes:

1.  Set the `baseURL` for your production site. This value must begin with the protocol and end with a slash, as shown above.
    
2.  Set the `languageCode` to your language and region.
    
3.  Set the `title` for your production site.
    

Start Hugo’s development server to see your changes, remembering to include draft content.

## Publish the site[](#publish-the-site)

In this step you will *publish* your site, but you will not *deploy* it.

When you *publish* your site, Hugo creates the entire static site in the `public` directory in the root of your project. This includes the HTML files, and assets such as images, CSS files, and JavaScript files.

When you publish your site, you typically do *not* want to include [draft, future, or expired content](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/usage/#draft-future-and-expired-content). The command is simple.

To learn how to *deploy* your site, see the [hosting and deployment](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/) section.

## Ask for help[](#ask-for-help)

Hugo’s [forum](https://discourse.gohugo.io/) is an active community of users and developers who answer questions, share knowledge, and provide examples. A quick search of over 20,000 topics will often answer your question. Please be sure to read about [requesting help](https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/requesting-help/9132) before asking your first question.
